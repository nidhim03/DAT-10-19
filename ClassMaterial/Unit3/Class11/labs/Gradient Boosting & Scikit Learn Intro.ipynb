    "\n",
    "This lab is designed to give everyone their first introduction to the Scikit-Learn API, and Gradient Boosting, one of the most powerful techniques in predictive modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this lab you'll see if you can build a model, understand its working parts, and make improvements to your results!  \n",
    "\n",
    "The great thing about `Scikit Learn` is that its API is almost identical from one algorithm to another, so once you get the hang of how to use it, using different methods is fairly seamless."
